    review: "I searched for fresh ideas for my newly created website. It was done from a technical perspective but the design was terrible. I needed some fresh new ideas and a contest was the best way to get new ideas. While most participants just send their portfolio, Md.A. really prepared some custom website where I could see the changes already. Epic! The ideas were creative and I'll definitly hire Md.A. again in the future to further improve the design of my website.",
